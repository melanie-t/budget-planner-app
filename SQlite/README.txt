Copy the dll file into your Java\jre...\bin folder.
If you don't know where your Java runtime environment folder is, you can probably find it
by pressing Windows Key, search for Java. Launch the "Configure Java" app, click Java tab,
then the "View" button.

Then, in Eclipse, go to Project > Properties > JavaBuildPath. Select the "Libraries" tab,
click the "Add External JARs" button. Navigate to this folder and select the .jar file.
Apply and close.

Click run and you should be good to go !
